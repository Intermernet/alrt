Ableton Live Randomize Tempo

Ever thought that 120BPM was boring?

Ever started a track in Ableton and realized that it rocks, but it doesn't rock so hard when you change the tempo?

The music composition process can be totally derailed by changing the tempo of the track you're working on, and the default new track in Ableton is at 120BPM.
You may set your default to something else, but then you're just dealing with the same problem at a different speed.

ALRT allows you to set a random (between set limits) BPM for your next track. Just script it to start before Ableton, and every track will have a slightly different BPM from the start.

Now get producing!
